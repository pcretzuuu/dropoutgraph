Task 2: Dropout graph
Implement Bar chart based on the dropout amount which is a real value (float/double) in percentage.
The amount of filling is based on teh value of the percentage.
There is not a defined number of nodes (bars) so the view has to be scrollable on the horizontal axis.
The bars can be of different types: BASIC OR SERVICE, which have according colors (blue for basic,  green for service)


You will receive a json from the API which looks like this:
data model:

NodeMap = {
	"node1": {
		label: "Contact Info",
		value: 100,
		type: "BASIC",
		adjList: ["node2"]
	},
	"node2": {
		label: "NemID",
		value: 95,
		type: "SERVICE",
		adjList: ["node3", "nodeBranch2"]
	},
	"node3": {
		label: "Personal Address",
		value: 95,
		type: "BASIC",
		adjList: []
	},
	"nodeBranch2":  {
		label: "Branch 2",
		value: 55,
		type: "BASIC",
		adjList: ["nodeBranch3"]

	},
	"nodeBranch3":  {
		label: "Branch 3",
		value: 25,
		type: "BASIC",
		adjList: []

	}
}
This graph contains one branch at "node2" but your implementation should be able to  support any number of branches.
Note you can  have branches further up the graph. I  will test if  it  works  properly.
The task needs to show knowledge of react framework. (w/ Webpack)
